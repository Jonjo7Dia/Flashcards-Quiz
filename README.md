This Project is to first take what I learnt in the "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" course found on Udemy and put it to use. 
I also have specifically chosen to create this project, because in the past when I have been studying for certain courses or subjects I have used Quizlet.com to create flashcards,
however recently Quizlet has added a "Pro" version to their users, which allows them to create flash cards with images. I decided I wanted to create my own version of a flashacrd creation site, which would enable creation of flashcards with the optional added feature of using images. 

I will be mimicing a lot of design elements from Quizlet, as I really do like their UI. yes
